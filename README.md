- Contact form has been switched to Google forms so that external provider is not required. Form is handled in `themes/hugo-cohub/assets/js/formhandler.js`, but for some reason it always returns an error even though it is successful.
- Google maps section has been removed via comments in `themes/hugo-cohub/layouts/index.html`.
- Other sections have been removed via `enable: false` in `.yaml` files.
- Maybe need social media to be more prominent?
